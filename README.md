# Dual-Disease-Prediction-System-Web-App


The Dual Disease Prediction Web App is a user-friendly tool developed in Python that enables users to predict the likelihood of two different diseases, which are Diabetes and Parkinson's disease based on input parameters. This web application is built to provide a quick and easy way for users to assess their risk of having two specific diseases simultaneously, using machine learning models.

# Features

User-Friendly Interface: The web app offers an intuitive interface where users can easily input relevant information.

Dual Disease Prediction: Unlike traditional tools that predict a single disease, this app simultaneously predicts the probability of two diseases, taking potential co-occurrence into account.

Machine Learning Models: The predictions are generated using pre-trained machine learning models that have been trained on a comprehensive dataset.

Data Privacy: User data is treated with the utmost confidentiality and is not stored or used for any purpose beyond generating predictions.

# Usage

Open the app in your web browser.

Enter the required information in the provided fields.

Click the "Predict" button to get the dual disease prediction.

The app will display the predicted probabilities for both diseases.
